# GroceryList_BarCode_Scanner
Using a barcode scanner create a grocery list /then print in pick order
The idea was to scan a list and store it to a file (/pLIST) and keep appending to it untill you are read to print it out
When printed out the list would go through sort program and print out the list in pick order
of course all stores are different and I'm trying to figure out the layout of each, we only shop a three stores so the scope of the project isn't that enormous.
